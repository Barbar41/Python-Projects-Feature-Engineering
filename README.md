#### Analysis comment

1-Analyzing the abundance of categorical variables.

2-Analyzing the relationship between rare categories and the dependent variable. 

3-We will write rare encoder. 

4-When there is a data set with plenty of categorical variables we should use Rare Analyzer and at least know

5-It is necessary to know which categorical variable's class, which frequency, which rate-dependent variable has an effect in terms of target.

#### 3-Writing the rare encoder.

1-Feature Scaling

2-StandardScaler: Classic standardization. Subtract the mean, divide by the standard deviation. z = (x - u) / s

3-RobustScaler: Subtract median and divide by iqr.

4-MinMaxScaler: Variable conversion between 2 given values

5-Numeric to Categorical: Converting Numeric Variables to Categorical Variables

#######################

--Dependent variable Survived, independent variables Paasnger id and variables other than Surived

--We divide the data set into two: train and test.

--We will hold a model in Train, we will be testing this model that I built with the test.

--Let's bring the model object, a tree-based method

--Setting up the model x train independent variables y train target dependent variable

--Prediction of dependent variables of the test set

--Set the test set with the dependent variable y

--The score to be obtained without any action?

--How are the newly produced variables doing?
